## Layer 1 — Python: Data Cleaning & EDA

**File:** `python/Analyzing_Airlines_delays.ipynb`

### What was done:
- Loaded and inspected the raw 2008 US Airline dataset (7M+ rows)
- Handled missing values, data type corrections, and outlier treatment
- Removed cancelled/diverted flights for clean delay analysis
- Exported filtered dataset for SQL ingestion

### EDA Visualisations Included:
- Average Arrival & Departure Delay by Airline (ranked bar charts)
- Average Delays by Departure Hour (dual-line time chart)
- Delay Contribution by Cause (pie chart)
- Correlation Heatmap Between All Delay Types

### Key EDA Insight:
The **0.87 correlation between departure and arrival delay** confirms airlines cannot recover lost time in the air — prevention at the gate is the only solution.

---

## Layer 2 — SQL: Deep-Dive Analysis

**File:** `sql/Analyzing_Airline_delays_2008.sql`

12 analytical queries covering:

| Query | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| q1 | Consistent Routes (low variance performers) |
| q2 | Route Symmetry (outbound vs return delay difference) |
| q3 | Route Delay Recovery (departure vs arrival delta) |
| q4 | Airline Consistency Score (std deviation ranking) |
| q5 | Airline Momentum Trend (month-over-month change) |
| q6 | Airline Severity Profile (mild/moderate/severe breakdown) |
| q7 | Airport Volume vs Delay (busiest airports ranked) |
| q8 | Airport Departure vs Arrival Profile |
| q9 | Departure Hour Risk Score |
| q10 | Monthly Rolling Trend (3-month moving average) |
| q11 | Delay Cause Totals by Airline |
| q12 | Dominant Delay Cause by Airline |

### SQL Techniques Used:
- Window Functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LAG`, rolling averages)
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for multi-step logic
- Aggregations with `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `CASE WHEN`
- Joins across multiple derived tables

## Layer 3 — Excel: Business Reporting

**File:** `excel/Airline_Delays_Analysis.xlsx`

6-sheet analysis workbook built for non-technical stakeholders:

| Sheet | Content |
|-------|---------|
| KPI Summary | 4 headline KPIs with conditional formatting |
| Monthly Trend | Month-by-month delay trend with best/worst callouts |
| Delay Cause Analysis | Cause breakdown with % contribution |
| Airline Performance | Full airline ranking table |
| Route Analysis | Top consistent and recovery routes |
| Airport Profiles | Volume vs delay positioning for 163 airports |

### Excel Features Used:
- Pivot Tables for dynamic aggregation
- `SUMIFS`, `AVERAGEIFS`, `COUNTIFS` for conditional calculations
- `VLOOKUP` and `INDEX-MATCH` for cross-sheet lookups
- Conditional formatting for performance tiers (Red/Amber/Green)
- Multi-series charts with helper tables

## Layer 4 — Tableau: Interactive Dashboards

**Live Link:** [US_Airline_Delay_Analysis_2008](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pratham.kumar5320/viz/US_Airline_Delay_Analysis_2008/Executive_Overview)

### Dashboard 1 — Executive Overview
![Executive Overview](assets/executive_overview.png)

A C-suite summary view showing headline KPIs, monthly delay trend, delay cause composition, and airline performance rankings at a glance.

---

### Dashboard 2 — Deep Dive Analysis
![Deep Dive Analysis](assets/deep_dive.png)

Operational-level analysis covering departure hour risk patterns, dominant delay cause by airline, and route delay recovery performance.

---

### Dashboard 3 — Airport Intelligence
![Airport Intelligence](assets/airport_intelligence.png)

Airport-level analysis showing the volume vs delay relationship across 163 airports, debunking the assumption that busier airports are always worse performers.

## Top 5 Insights from This Project

1. **70.62% of delays are airline-controllable** — this is not a weather or infrastructure crisis, it's an operational one.

2. **Flying at 3–4 AM has paradoxically the highest delays** (~57 mins) due to cascading network disruptions carried over from the previous day. The safest window is **5–8 AM**.

3. **Late Aircraft Delay (40.3%) is the dominant cause** — a single delayed inbound flight triggers a chain of downstream delays across the network.

4. **Busier airports are NOT necessarily worse** — the scatter analysis reveals that high-volume airports like ATL and DFW maintain average performance, while mid-size airports like JFK structurally underperform.

5. **The 0.87 correlation between departure and arrival delay** confirms airlines cannot recover lost time in flight — operational fixes must happen at the gate, not in the air.

## How to Reproduce This Project

### Python
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/prathamkumarr/Analyzing-Airline-Delays

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter

# Launch notebook
jupyter notebook python/Analyzing_Airlines_delays.ipynb
```

### SQL
```sql
-- Run in PostgreSQL
-- Load filtered dataset first, then execute:
\i sql/Analyzing_Airline_delays_2008.sql
```

### Dataset
The original dataset is the **2008 Airline On-Time Performance** dataset from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Due to file size, it is not included in this repo. Download from [BTS Website](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx).
